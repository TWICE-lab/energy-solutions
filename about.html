      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>We're a team of passionate energy problem-solvers who believe reliable power should be simple, affordable, and sustainable.

Founded by David Kwabena Amenuku - an electrical engineer with hands-on experience from industrial sites to family homes - we bridge technical expertise with genuine care for our customers.

What makes us different?
• We listen first, then design solutions that actually fit your life
• We train local technicians because knowledge should empower communities
• We stand by our work - from the solar panels we install to the skills we teach

At our core, we're not just an electrical company - we're your partners in building a brighter, more energy-secure future for Ghana.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We’re on a simple mission: to bring light, opportunity, and peace of mind to every community we serve.

For families, that means:
No more sleepless nights over blackouts or sky-high bills
No more worrying about unsafe wiring or security
Just reliable power—clean, affordable, and tailored to your life
For Ghana’s future, that means:
Real skills for real people through hands-on training
Good jobs created by certifying the next generation of technicians
Stronger communities powered by sustainable energy
Founded by David Kwabena Amenuku—a local electrician who grew tired of seeing energy struggles hold people back—we don’t just install systems. We build relationships and hope, one solar panel, one repaired wire, one trained graduate at a time.</p>
