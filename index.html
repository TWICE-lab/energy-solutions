      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We believe everyone deserves clean, reliable energy - and the knowledge to use it. That's why we don't just install solar 
        panels and electrical systems; we build relationships. We listen to your needs, design solutions that fit your life, and stand 
        by our work with honest service. Through hands-on training programs, we're creating a new generation of skilled technicians who 
        can light up their own communities. Every wire we connect, every trainee we certify, every home we power - it's all part of our 
        promise to make energy simpler, smarter, and more sustainable for real people.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>We design solar systems that cut your bills, fix electrical problems that disrupt your day, 
        install security systems that protect what matters, and train passionate technicians who will
         light up Ghana's future.</p>
